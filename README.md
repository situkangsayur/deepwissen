# machine-learning engine with Deep Neural Network Engine
Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that "gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" (Arthur Samuel, 1959). This Project is machine learning engine that can be used for any purpose, and and added deep learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of neural network.
